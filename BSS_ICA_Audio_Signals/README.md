**Audio Signal Separation and Performance Comparison Using different ICA algorithms and filters**
			
The Project was based on Blind Source Separation (BSS) –solving a cocktail party problem’ (i.e., N number of people speaking in a room and N microphones recording them along with noise. Each microphone records the mixture of the N audio signals).

The mixture of signals (cocktail party problem) is separated using a technique called ICA (Independent Component Analysis) to get the original independent signals. And then reduced noise in the audio signals using IIR and FIR Filters

Also, implemented and compared three different ICA algorithms namely FastICA, JADE and TDSEP.

Implemntation of Brain Computer Interface system based on Steady State Visually Evoked Potentials

Definition of BCI

A technology that translates human intention, as measured from brain activity, into control signals for an external device.

Motivation

It can help
  A paralysed person who has lost control over limbs
  
  An amputee who has lost limb(s).
  
  A locked-in person, who has lost all muscular activity.

Introduction to BCI & SSVEP

What is SSVEP?

  When light falls on the retina, evokes a signal in the occipital (connected with vision) area.

  If the light comes on and off repeatedly, so does this signal

  Let a visual stimulus be intentionally flickered on and off at a  known frequency. 

  Presence of a signal at the same frequency in the EEG from the occipital area indicates that the subject is looking at the stimulus.

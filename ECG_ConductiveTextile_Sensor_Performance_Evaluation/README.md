Performance Evaluation of Woven Conductive Dry Textile Electrodes for Continuous ECG Signals Acquisition

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal monitoring is one of the essential techniques for determining the physiological state of human beings. Long-term ECG monitoring is very much essential for the diagnosis and treatment of infrequent arrhythmic episodes. Although, most of the wearable microelectronic ECG implementations employ the well-established surface electrodes technology for bio-potential recordings; they are found to be susceptible to skin irritation and influence the skin-contact impedance to larger extent in long-term monitoring applications. Integration of such sensors into wearable intelligent biomedical clothing is not feasible. This specific research study determines the application of two different conductive textile fabric materials, namely, the woven conductive silver and conductive knitted jersey as dry textile electrodes for ECG biopotential acquisition. The skin-electrode contact impedance measurements for both electrodes presented reduced skin-contact impedance of less than 1 MΩ /cm 2 compared to 1–5 MΩ /cm 2 as reported in literature. The performance of the proposed textile sensors is evaluated qualitatively through visual inspection and quantitatively using metrics such as power spectral density, kurtosis, baseline wander analysis, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The obtained quantitative measures were compared with standard clinical grade conductive-gel based disposable Ag/AgCl surface electrodes. The simulation and comparison studies showed that, the proposed textile electrodes exhibit acceptable performance for ECG acquisition and in some instances improved performance than the traditional commercial disposable gel-based surface electrodes.
